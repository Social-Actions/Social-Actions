The following workflow will generate sets of social features for Twitter users


0. download c++ boost libraries and add to "util" folder
	- have it such that "Social-Features/util/boost/tuple/tuple.hpp" is a valid path
1. ensure c code is compiled:
		% cd features
		% make clean
		% make
2. add Twitter json files to "collection" folder
	- have it such that "Social-Features/collection/<filename>.json" is one of the files
	- scripts expect files in the format the Twitter streaming API uses
3. make a directory "results"
4. execute the lines in fsets/fsets.txt in order while in "results" folder
	Note: 	You'll need twittercollect and simplejson python packages installed
			You'll also need the unix program sort installed
	- commands need to execute in that order
	- some commands will take a while to execute
	- some scripts (conv and prop) require large amounts of memory
	- memory needed depends on the size of the timeline
	- also a number of intermediate files will be created. some are large.
	- total size of intermediate files is less than the size of the collection
